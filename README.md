# QA for EdTech

This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. Project is all about building a Q&A system for an e-learning company. The dataset primarily consists of questions asked by users in forums, where they seek clarification, assistance, or additional information related to courses. These forums serve as dynamic spaces for learners to engage with both the content and each other. This system will provide a streamlit based user interface for students where they can ask questions and get answers.
